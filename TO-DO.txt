- Access point or config via serial terminal.
- MQTT transmissions in a single block.
- Temperature sensor readout in a single block.
- Limit IP Geolocation to every Sunday (copy code from the fork)
- Add static zime zone data if IP Geo is disabled  (copy code from the fork)



Martinius:

Fix BUG:
1) If power is off, the displays changed, switch on again
2) If MQTT is on, but not reachable, always three seconds hanging clock
3) If client ID is present two times, Wifi drops on MQTT message sent (discovery i.e.) -> Infinite loop -> protect against that

change menu order -> clock face selection first!

button mechanism with interrupts -> more then single clicks!

MQTT HA integration for switching Timezones

switch clock faces by left and right buttons
switch clock faces by single click in IPSTubes
menu with double click on IPSTubes

Add RLE decoding!!!

switch/Updating dimming must be callable, not only every full hour, because vlues should be changeable from menu for start and stop of dimming

Faster drawings! Must be possible, if framerates up tp 20fps and more are possible on the dispaly, according to other esp32 devs

Show Date and Month
Album mode
nice menu
"animations", like flip clock
support jpg and png
hold all clock face files in RAM -> only for clocks with PSRAM -> MarvelTubes and NoveLife so far
new counting and using mechanism for clock faces
Start/Boot animation

Generate "Numitron" clock face

Bluetooth control via website or fatclient desktop app
mobile app

implement a geo location list and a location variable to let the user set the geo location manually once
then get the offset from there and with the date of DST begin and end from there, switch the time
search a library for this

webserver for controling

Generate screen safer images programatically (like Matrix rain or flying triangles)

Generate some easy "clock faces" programatically, like seven segment display with different colours or better 16 segment
directly connected -> generate also "letters" https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentanzeige
moving texts in the displays...

Implement an Alarm clock -> Buzz for the ones with a buzzer -> blink on display, if no buzzer
